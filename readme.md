watch command:
sass --watch app/assets/styles:app/public  

must run on node 6.3.x for the debug script to run properly.

###### todo

near term:

basic styling  
custom time picker
client & serverside form validations w/ visible err handling (numbers -- are they real, reasonable pushups range, etc.)
phone number validator  
confirmation text message  

longterm:  
Unit & integration testing  
billing  

create a test button that fills in the field with my number, pushups, the current time plus 1 minute.
tests will go to my number for now.
