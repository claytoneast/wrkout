watch command:
sass --watch app/assets/styles:app/public

###### todo

near term:

basic styling
custom time picker
client & serverside form validations w/ visible err handling (numbers, are they real, reasonable pushups range, etc.)
phone number validator

longterm:
tests LOL JK

I have no test number to receive on besides my own. so i'll receive at mine.
create a test button maybe, that fills in the field with my number, pushups, the current time plus like, 1 minute.
need to schedule the stuff right away then...
